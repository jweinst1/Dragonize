# Dragonize

Dragonize is a JS library that contains tools and algorithms for analyzing chatting text, or conversation text, and generating response texts to queries.
Dragonize is currently in early development stages, with both back-end and client side scripts meant to be added in it. Eventually, part of Dragonize will be turned into a Node Module, and some
of it will be packaged into a chatbot EmberJS app.
